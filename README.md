# instrument-maker-symbols
A set of open source AAC symbols for electronic music and sonic arts. 

I started making these symbols for projects with Drake Music and City Lit (particularly the current Hidden Sounds course), to provide alternative access to topics that are sometimes overlooked in an AAC/learning-Disability support context.   For more examples of similar symbols and usage, see these posts: [blog 1](https://www.drakemusic.org/blog/charles-matthews/improvisation-resources/) | [blog 2](https://www.drakemusic.org/blog/charles-matthews/informing-ipad-play-with-movement-in-the-classroom/). There's absolutely no reason their use should be limited to these contexts though.

The inspiration to put this online as a public repository comes from [Mulberry Symbols](https://mulberrysymbols.org/), an open source set of images for communication use. I have borrowed their format and hope to contribute some of these back as well.

My intention is to gradually export my current set from [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/) to SVG, and continue building a resource that I can use for the [Instrument Maker](https://github.com/matthewscharles/instrument-maker) project.

Contributions are welcome, particularly with direct feedback from people who will use these symbols on a daily basis.  Please get in touch.

No reason that this should be limited to music technology; it'd be nice to to incorporate some more generic musical symbols (and for me in particular, gamelan-based material) down the line.  An alternative to established mainstream musical aesthetics would definitely be appreciated..

Maybe we could think of a catchier name, too?
