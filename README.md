#More information

I've had an interested in AAC since working with a friend on a sprawling set of Grid pages back in 2014. I started making these music-based symbols to use on projects with [Drake Music](http://www.drakemusic.org/) and [City Lit](http://www.citylit.ac.uk/) (particularly the current [Hidden Sounds](https://www.citylit.ac.uk/courses/specialist-learning/courses-for-people-with-learning-difficulties) sonic art course), to provide alternative access to topics that are sometimes overlooked in the context of AAC and supporting people who are disabled by more traditional/mainstream learning environments.  For examples of similar symbols and usage on the Exchanging Notes project, see these posts: [blog 1](https://www.drakemusic.org/blog/charles-matthews/improvisation-resources/) | [blog 2](https://www.drakemusic.org/blog/charles-matthews/informing-ipad-play-with-movement-in-the-classroom/). 

The inspiration to put this online as a public repository comes from [Mulberry Symbols](https://mulberrysymbols.org/), an open source set of images for communication use. I have borrowed their format and hope to contribute some of these back as well.

My intention is to gradually export my current set from [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/) to SVG, and continue building a resource that I can use for the [Instrument Maker](https://github.com/matthewscharles/instrument-maker) project.  Mulberry Symbols feature automatic generation of a list as PDF, and I like the idea of automating some multi-language sets.

Contributions are welcome, particularly from people who will use these symbols on a daily basis, whether directly or through feedback/conversation.  Please get in touch.

No reason that this should be limited to music technology or educational contexts; it'd be nice to to incorporate some more generic musical symbols (and for me in particular, gamelan-based material) down the line.  An alternative to established mainstream musical aesthetics would definitely be appreciated..

Maybe we could think of a catchier name, too?
