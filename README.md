##Information

The idea is to provide alternative access to topics that are sometimes overlooked in the contexts of AAC and support for people who are disabled by more traditional/"mainstream" learning environments.  

I've had an interest in AAC since working with a friend on a sprawling set of [Grid](https://thinksmartbox.com/) collections back in 2005. I started making these music-based symbols to use on projects with [Drake Music](http://www.drakemusic.org/) and [City Lit](http://www.citylit.ac.uk/) (particularly the current [Hidden Sounds](https://twitter.com/matthewscharles/status/1045346922654048257) sonic art course). For examples of similar symbols and usage on the [Exchanging Notes](https://www.drakemusic.org/exchanging-notes/) project, see these posts: [blog 1](https://www.drakemusic.org/blog/charles-matthews/improvisation-resources/) | [blog 2](https://www.drakemusic.org/blog/charles-matthews/informing-ipad-play-with-movement-in-the-classroom/). These can fit outside these context just as easily though; I find text difficult to deal with and use similar symbols a lot in my everyday life: emojis in calendars, etc..

The inspiration to put this online as a public repository comes from [Mulberry Symbols](https://mulberrysymbols.org/), an open source set of images for communication use. I have applied some of their format (size, folder structure) onto my existing symbols for compatibility, and hope to contribute some of these as well. However I do not consider this as building directly on the work (the main reason for stating this distinction being that I have not yet decided upon the appropriate licensing for this set).

My intention is to gradually export my current set from [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/) to SVG, and continue building a resource that I can use for the [Instrument Maker](https://github.com/matthewscharles/instrument-maker) project.  Mulberry Symbols feature automatic generation of a list as PDF, and I like the idea of automating some multi-language sets.

Contributions are welcome, particularly from people who will use these symbols on a daily basis, whether directly or through feedback/conversation.  Please get in touch.

No reason that this should be limited to music technology or educational contexts; it'd be nice to to incorporate some more generic musical symbols (and for me in particular, gamelan-based material) down the line.  An alternative to established mainstream musical aesthetics would definitely be appreciated..

Maybe we could think of a catchier name, too?

##How to use

At present, you may download these images as a .zip file by clicking on the green **clone or download** button above.  Unzip, and go to the EN folder.  SVG files are compatible with many graphics programs, and these symbols can be imported into [Widget Online](https://widgitonline.com/).  Alternatively, download a PDF of the first set, ready to cut and laminate, [here](http://ardisson.net/instrument-maker/autogenerated-instrument-maker-symbols.pdf).

Please consider giving credit where possible, and link back to this repository (you could also link to [Mulberry](https://mulberrysymbols.org/) to raise awareness of this Open Source approach).

This project is a labour of love..if you appreciate the resources and want to offer a little financial support, you could [buy me a (decaf) coffee](https://ko-fi.com/matthewscharles) or [grab some music](https://ardisson.bandcamp.com/album/peaks).
