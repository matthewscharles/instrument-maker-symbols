As this project begins, I could use help with:

- Direct input from people who would use this directly (and also facilitators/teachers) suggestions for the wishlist / categories page (and translations)
- Examples of symbols (please get in touch before working on specific symbols, as I may be uploading these myself)
- Advice on management and generation of SVG files, other formats
- Code to interact with these symbols: grid sheets, etc.
- Other access/accessibility concerns (e.g. how could descriptions for screen readers best be incorporated)
- Suggestions for diverse representation and more specifically representation of Disability culture with regards to music.

More information to follow, but most importantly, get in touch so that we can start a conversation!
